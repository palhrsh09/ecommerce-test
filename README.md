A Link to the Working Demo:The live version of the eCommerce platform is hosted on Vercel and can be explored at https://ecommerce-test-tawny-three.vercel.app/. This link provides direct access to the deployed application, allowing users to interact with the product catalog, view detailed product cards, and experience the seamless functionality we have implemented.

A Detailed Note Explaining the Design and Implementation:  

Layout Approach: The user interface is crafted using Bootstrap's powerful grid system, which forms the foundation of a card-based design. This approach ensures a consistent, modern, and visually appealing layout across all pages of the application. Each product is presented in a dedicated card, enhancing readability and providing an intuitive shopping experience, while the integration of React components allows for dynamic content management and scalability.
Responsiveness Considerations: To cater to a wide range of devices, the design incorporates responsive breakpoints with col-md-4, col-sm-6, and col-12 classes. These classes dynamically adjust the width of product cards based on screen size, ensuring an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Additionally, the use of object-fit: cover for product images prevents stretching or distortion, maintaining high-quality visuals regardless of the device's resolution or aspect ratio. This meticulous attention to responsiveness guarantees accessibility and usability for all users.



We extend our gratitude to the team and stakeholders for their invaluable support throughout the development process. This project sets a strong foundation for future enhancements, and we welcome your feedback to further refine and improve the application. Thank you for being part of this journey!
